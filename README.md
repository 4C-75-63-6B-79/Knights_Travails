## Desciption
This is my solution of the assignment **[Knight Travails](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails)** given in the **The Odin Project**. To get a better understanding of how to solve the problem I used this [source](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/knights-shortest-path-chessboard). To make the interactive part I took the idea form **[top solution](https://github.com/Kiwasthal/Knight-travails)** of this assignment at that time.

### How To Use the Thing?
- To Place a knight or to select the starting loaction click on the `Place Knight` button. One can also use Randomly `Knight Place` button to place the knight anywhere on the board.
- To select the destination or the end position of the knight click on the `Select Destination` button.
- To find the path how the knight reaches the end position from the start path click on the `Start Travails` button.
- When you have found the path and again press the `Place Knight` or `Randomly Place Kinght` or `Select Destination` button the previous path will disappear form screen. But the previous knight starting and ending position are still in memory until you select the new position. To remove these from the memory to press `Clear Board` button.
